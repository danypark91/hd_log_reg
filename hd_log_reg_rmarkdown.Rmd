## 1. Overview of Logistic Regression
Consider a dataset with the response variable(Y) falls into two categories. Logistic regression is a statistical model that focuses on the probability of each Y variable's class given values of the independent variables(X). Since the model is based on the probability, at any given X value, the result has to fall between 0 and 1. Mathematically speaking, 0 ≤ P(X) ≤ 1. The value of P(X) should always produce the outputs within the range.

The regression is fitted using the maximum likelihood method because of its statistical properties. The method estimates the model's coefficients such that the predicted probability corresponds as closely as possible to the individual's observations. In other words, predicted β0 and β1 are found such that plugging these estimates into p(X), yields a number close to one for all individuals who defaulted, and a number close to zero for all individuals who did not¹.

## 2. The Dataset 
The original [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) from UCI contained 76 attributes which represent a patient's condition. The dataset for this article is from [Kaggle - Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci). The subset of 14 attributes with every incident represents a patient.

| Attribute | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| target | Patients with heart disease, Response variable |
| age | Age of patients |
| sex | Gender of patients |
| cp | chest pain type (4 values) |
| trestbps | resting blood pressure |
| sr | serum cholestoral in mg/dl |
| fbs | fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl |
| restang | resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2) |
| hr | maximum heart rate achieved |
| exang | exercise induced angina |
| oldpeak | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest |
| slope | the slope of the peak exercise ST segment |
| fbs | number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy |
| thal | 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect |

The data is imported from the local device and printed summary of the dataframe to get the overview. 
```{r Importation, echo=TRUE}
#import dataframe: csv
df<-read.csv("heart.csv", header =TRUE)
summary(df)
head(df,5)
```
The dataset has total of 14 attributes and 303 incidences. Of those, `sex`, `cp`, `fbs`, `restecg`, `exang`, `slope`, `thal` and `target` are the categorical variable. The rest, `age`, `trestbps`, `chol`, `thalach` and `oldpeak`, are the continuous variable. However, before we proceed, there's an erronous attribute: `ï..age`. It is corrected to `age`. 

```{r Attribute name change, echo=TRUE}
#change erronous attribute name:  ï..age
colnames(df)[colnames(df)=='ï..age'] <-'age'
head(df,5)

```

```{r Change of attribute type, echo=TRUE}
#check the type of each attribute and change to factor or int
str(df)

df$sex <- as.factor(df$sex)
df$cp <- as.factor(df$cp)
df$fbs <- as.factor(df$fbs)
df$restecg <- as.factor(df$restecg)
df$exang <- as.factor(df$exang)
df$slope <- as.factor(df$slope)
df$thal <- as.factor(df$thal)
```

```{r Missmap, echo=TRUE}
#check for any missing data
library(Amelia)
missmap(df, main = "Missing Data vs Observed")

```

```{r Count each categorical value, echo=TRUE}
#check the ratio of reponse variable and see if it requires to rebalance
library(plyr)
count(df,vars="target")
```
